'''
Given a String S, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. Words are separated by dots.

Example 1:

Input:
S = i.like.this.program.very.much
Output: much.very.program.this.like.i
Explanation: After reversing the whole
string(not individual words), the input
string becomes
much.very.program.this.like.i
'''

    def reverseWords(self,S):
        # code here
        words = S.split('.')
        reverse = words[::-1]
        output = '.'.join(reverse)
        
        return output

            if len(set(group)) == 1:       # if the length of the set of tuple is 1 then only value in tuple gets to the prefix
                prefix += group[0]

        return prefix or -1             # IF there is a prefix value return it else give -1 as output
